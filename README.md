# Cybersecurity Hacktoberfest repository 

**This repository contains two very basic  programmes which one is focused on ``networking`` while other on </br> a very beginner yet very important vulnerability ``information gathering``**

</br>

***Key Logger***

`Key logger, often referred to as keystroke logger or keyboard capture, is the action of recording the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly ,so that person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. A key logger can be a software or a physical device we will be making one such software in this directory.`


***Know_Your_IP***

`IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers that are typically displayed in dotted decimal notation. A 32-bit address contains two primary parts: the network prefix and the host number. All hosts within a single network share the same network address. Each host also has an address that uniquely identifies it. IPv4 addresses are also classified into 5 different classes.`
